## This repo contains code samples from JetThouths developers.

To add code you need to create a folder with your initials in JetThought.
These initials are used in your jetThoughts mail for example(**dgo**@jetthought.com)

If you want to add project, add subfolder for it. Separate scripts you can add just in your folder.

There is no need to make a separate PR for your samples. You can simply commit them to the master branch.
